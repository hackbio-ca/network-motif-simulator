## Abstract

Biological networks, such as gene regulatory, metabolic, and protein interaction networks, are fundamental to understanding the complex dynamics that govern cellular processes. Network motifs, defined as recurrent and statistically significant subgraph patterns within these networks, play a critical role in determining system behaviour and robustness. This paper presents a novel network motif simulation tool that allows users to generate network motif maps and visualise their dynamic properties. The tool provides an intuitive interface for constructing biological networks, identifying key motifs, and simulating their time-dependent behaviour. Users can explore different motif topologies, such as feedforward loops, feedback loops, and bifan motifs, and observe how these structures influence the overall dynamics of the system. By combining network motif analysis with dynamic simulations, this tool empowers researchers to investigate the functional consequences of specific motifs in biological networks, facilitating deeper insights into cellular regulatory mechanisms and their role in biological complexity.
